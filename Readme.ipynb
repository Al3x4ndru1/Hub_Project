    "The project's genesis occurred during a course at my university, where we were privileged to have a representative from Oracle join us as the client for our team. During this engagement, the representative articulated his vision, and I carried the team leader and sole developer role. Drawing upon my expertise as a full-stack developer, I embarked on creating a mobile application and a Spring Boot server, both augmented with artificial intelligence capabilities to identify various health conditions such as ADHD, Autism, and Dyslexia. \n",
